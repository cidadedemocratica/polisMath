The following was computed on the a 5000x10 conversation; it seems that reflection is one of our problems here

Here are the reflection warnings that matter to our lib

    Auto-boxing loop arg: current-indent
    exception.clj:44 recur arg for primitive local: i is not matching primitive, had: Object, needed: long
    Auto-boxing loop arg: i

Fuck... this doesn't seem to be working. I took away all of the reflection warnings with a type-indexof
function, but still no dice. What's left of the reflections:

    (defn typed-indexof [^java.util.List coll item]
      (.indexOf coll item))
